# 3D-Atom-Simulation-using-Blender 
Welcome to the first-ever repository dedicated to 3D atom simulation! ⚛️ This project aims to provide an interactive, visual representation of atomic structures and behaviors in a 3D environment. 
By leveraging advanced graphics and simulation algorithms, this repository offers a cutting-edge tool for exploring and understanding atomic models in real time.

## Features 🚀
- **Real-time 3D visualization** of atomic structures. 👀
- **Interactive controls** for manipulating and observing atoms. 🖱️
- **Exiting animations** of atomic behavior using simulation algorithms.
- **Educational tool** for students and researchers to explore atomic physics. 📚
- **Dynamic Input** to check find any any orbital shape

## Technology Stack: 🛠️
- **Blender** 🟧 ([Dowload Blender here](https://www.blender.org/download/))

## Programming Language Experience: 💻
- **Python** 🐍

## System Requirements: 🖥️
- A 64-bit dual-core CPU.
- 8 GB of RAM.
- A GPU with 4 GB of VRAM that supports OpenGL 4.3.

## Installation: ⚙️
**Method 1 :** (Direct)
1. Clone the repository:
   
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ObbuNithin/3D-Atom-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Open the Blender from the folder. The main files are generalization2(you can dynamically view the animations) and slowed animation.

3. Download Additional Files
Some large files required for the simulation are available in Google Drive:
[🔗 Download Additional Files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VNseyBoxj1Z46bqfRAfZ6akSDxMyXg_r?usp=sharing)
  
4. Run the program and make sure to use the console created in the project (For dynamic input).

5. To use the console after excuting the program click N and search for Tools where the input is taken

**Note guys this is a basic implemetation of the 3d atom simulation however you can explore more using these file.**

**ALL THE BEST!!**
